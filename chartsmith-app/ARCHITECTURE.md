# Architecture and Design for Chartsmith-app

This is a next.js project that is the front end for chartsmith.

## Monaco Editor Implementation
- Avoid recreating editor instances
- Use a single editor instance with model swapping for better performance
- Properly clean up models to prevent memory leaks
- We want to make sure that we don't show a "Loading..." state because it causes a lot of UI flashes.

## State managemnet
- Do not pass onChange and other callbacks through to child components
- We use jotai for state, each component should be able to get or set the state it needs
- Each component subscribes to the relevant atoms. This is preferred over callbacks.

## SSR
- We use server side rendering to avoid the "loading" state whenever possible. 
- Move code that requires "use client" into separate controls.

## Database and functions
- We aren't using Next.JS API routes, except when absolutely necessary.
- Front end should call server actions, which call lib/* functions.
- Database queries are not allowed in the server action. Server actions are just wrappers for which lib functions we expose.
