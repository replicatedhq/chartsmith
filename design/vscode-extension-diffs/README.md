# Native Diff Implementation for Chartsmith Extension

This document explores an approach for replacing VS Code's built-in diff functionality with Chartsmith's own native diff experience from the main application.

## Current Implementation

Currently, the Chartsmith extension uses VS Code's native diff functionality:

- Creates virtual documents with the current file content and proposed changes
- Uses VS Code's `vscode.diff` command to display these documents side-by-side
- Implements custom buttons for accepting/rejecting changes
- Handles file content storage and synchronization

## Strategic Goals and Unified Experience

A key strategic goal for this implementation is to **unify the Chartsmith experience across platforms** - whether using the browser application or the VS Code extension. Key aspects of this strategy include:

### 1. Consistent User Experience

- Users would encounter the same UI patterns and workflows regardless of platform
- Visual consistency in diff presentation, controls, and actions reduces cognitive load
- Familiar navigation and interaction patterns help when switching contexts

### 2. Upstream-First Architecture

- The implementation follows an "upstream-first" approach, where the remote workspace serves as the primary source of functionality and data
- The VS Code extension adapts and integrates with the remote workspace rather than implementing standalone features
- Instead of duplicating diff handling logic in the VS Code extension, the implementation delegates to the remote workspace for processing diffs, applying changes, and managing state. This ensures that complex operations like conflict resolution and version tracking remain consistent regardless of where a user accesses Chartsmith.

### 3. Streamlined Synchronized Workspace Model

The architecture creates an efficient, secure flow for synchronizing workspaces between local and remote environments:

- **User-Initiated Changes**: All modifications begin with explicit user actions in the VS Code extension (accepting/rejecting diffs)
- **Remote Workspace Processing**: When a user accepts a change locally, the request is sent to the remote workspace for processing and application
- **Confirmation Flow**: After successful application to the remote workspace, the extension receives confirmation and only then applies the same changes locally
- **Transaction Integrity**: This sequence ensures both environments remain in sync, with changes only applied locally after confirmed remote application

This model eliminates redundancy while maintaining security, ensuring that local changes are only finalized after successful remote processing, creating a consistent state across platforms without requiring users to approve the same change multiple times.

## The Case for a Custom Diff Implementation

### Webview-Based Architecture with Remote Workspace as Source of Truth

The Chartsmith extension already uses a webview-based architecture to communicate with remote workspaces. Extending this pattern to diffs while using the remote workspace as the source of truth offers several key advantages:

1. **Centralized State and Communication**:
   - The remote workspace acts as the single source of truth for all diff states
   - The webview facilitates bidirectional communication between local and remote environments
   - Changes propagate efficiently in both directions through established communication channels
   
2. **Unified User Experience**:
   - Consistent visual design and interaction patterns across all platforms
   - Users encounter the same workflows regardless of access method (browser or VS Code)
   - Brand identity and design language remain consistent across all touchpoints

3. **Simplified Development and Maintenance**:
   - Reduces duplication of code between the web app and VS Code extension
   - Leverages existing components and patterns from the main application
   - Centralizes complex logic like conflict resolution and version tracking
   
4. **Improved Debugging and Quality Assurance**:
   - State changes are more transparent and traceable through server-side logging
   - Centralized management simplifies testing and validation
   - Reduces context-switching between client and server debugging

## Challenges to Consider

While the webview-based approach offers numerous advantages, there are challenges to consider:

### 1. Performance Considerations

- Webviews add overhead compared to native VS Code components
- Large diffs or many simultaneous diffs may impact performance
- Network latency can affect the user experience when communicating with remote workspaces

### 2. Integration Limitations

- Some VS Code features are difficult to replicate in a webview
- Extension capabilities are more limited than native VS Code functionality
- User expectations about standard editor behavior

### 3. Development Complexity

- Maintaining the webview implementation may add complexity of its own
- Ensuring proper synchronization requires careful design
