# Workflows

## Workflow 1: Initial User Input (Conversational Flow)

1. User types a question in the frontend chat interface
2. Frontend sends message to API endpoint â†’ saves to database
3. Worker picks up job from PostgreSQL work queue
4. Expands the prompt to improve context understanding
5. Gets embeddings from Voyage AI to vectorize the question
6. Finds relevant files using vector similarity search in pgvector
7. Sends to Claude with the user's question + relevant file context
8. Streams response back through Centrifugo websocket
9. Frontend displays the streaming response in real-time

    participant Frontend
    participant API
    participant PostgreSQL
    participant Worker
    participant VoyageAI
    participant pgvector
    participant Claude
    participant Centrifugo

    User->>Frontend: Types question in chat
    Frontend->>API: Send message
    API->>PostgreSQL: Save message to database
    PostgreSQL->>Worker: Notify via work queue
    Worker->>Worker: Expand prompt
    Worker->>VoyageAI: Get embeddings for question
    VoyageAI-->>Worker: Return embeddings
    Worker->>pgvector: Vector similarity search
    pgvector-->>Worker: Return relevant files
    Worker->>Claude: Send question + file context
    Claude-->>Centrifugo: Stream response
    Centrifugo-->>Frontend: WebSocket stream
    Frontend-->>User: Display real-time response
```

## Workflow 2: User Requests Changes (Plan Execution)

1. User asks for changes to their Helm chart
2. System generates a plan using Claude listing what files need changes
3. For each file change:
   - Vectorizes the change description using Voyage AI
   - Vectorizes every file in the Helm chart
   - Finds closest matches using cosine similarity
   - Sends to Claude: relevant files + specific change request
   - Claude returns complete modified file contents
4. Creates diff patches comparing original vs modified files
5. Sends patches to frontend for user review
6. User approves/rejects each change
7. Applies approved patches to update the workspace files

    User->>Frontend: Request changes to Helm chart
    Frontend->>Worker: Trigger plan generation
    Worker->>Claude: Generate plan for changes
    Claude-->>Worker: Return plan with file list
    Worker-->>Frontend: Display plan to user
    
    loop For each file in plan
        Worker->>Worker: Process file change
        Worker->>VoyageAI: Vectorize change description
        VoyageAI-->>Worker: Return change embeddings
        Worker->>VoyageAI: Vectorize all Helm files
        VoyageAI-->>Worker: Return file embeddings
        Worker->>pgvector: Find closest matches (cosine similarity)
        pgvector-->>Worker: Return relevant files
        Worker->>Claude: Send change request + relevant files
        Claude-->>Worker: Return modified file content
        Worker->>Worker: Store modified content
    end
    
    Worker->>Worker: Create diff patches
    Worker->>Frontend: Send patches for review
    Frontend->>User: Display patches
    
    alt User approves changes
        User->>Frontend: Approve patches
        Frontend->>Worker: Apply approved patches
        Worker->>Workspace: Update files with patches
        Worker-->>Frontend: Confirm success
        Frontend-->>User: Show success message
    else User rejects changes
        User->>Frontend: Reject patches
        Frontend->>Worker: Discard changes
        Worker-->>Frontend: Confirm cancellation
        Frontend-->>User: Show cancellation message
    end
```
